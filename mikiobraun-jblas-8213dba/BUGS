Known Bugs:

- tempfiles don't get deleted under Windows

  Under Windows, the JVM cannot delete the temp files used to extract the data
  once these files are linked because you cannot delete a file as long as
  someone has it opened.

  Workaround is to clear out the temp directory from time to time.

- XERBLA handling under Mac OS X (still current?)

  Under Mac OS X, xerbla isn't properly handled, leading to an error message
and the exit of the program. The linker does not take our own version
of xerbla, but instead uses the one supplied by the BLAS library. I
still need to figure out what the right options are.
